 * define-material-flow.ts — the public `defineMaterialFlow` API (Plan 194 §2.2).
 *
 * ONE definition per material-flow component type, THREE layers:
 *   - `logic`      — shared state-machine + routing (mode-agnostic; no time/physics)
 *   - `continuous` — public adapter (trigger = sensor/poll, effect = physics, 60 Hz)
 *   - `des`        — private adapter record (trigger = events, effect = time)
 *
 * `defineMaterialFlow(def)` registers the definition for dual discovery
 * (`registerMaterialFlow`, registry.ts): the continuous-matcher resolves
 * `models[]` against loaded models, a `registerComponent` schema adapter feeds
 * the GLB loader, and each `des` hook is namespaced `<type>.<Hook>`.
 *
 * Shim: `toBehavior(def)` adapts a definition to the existing `Behavior`
 * (`continuous.setup`→`bind`, `continuous.fixedUpdate`→`rv.onFixedUpdate`) so a
 * material-flow component is `defineBehavior`-compatible at runtime and existing
 * BehaviorManager discovery keeps every current test green.
